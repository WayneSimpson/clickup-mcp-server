# PRD: OpenAI MCP Compatibility Investigation & Implementation

## Executive Summary

**Mission**: Investigate and implement changes to make the ClickUp MCP Server compatible with OpenAI ChatGPT Custom Connectors while maintaining full Claude Desktop compatibility.

**Current Status**: Server works perfectly with Claude Desktop but fails with OpenAI ChatGPT Custom Connectors (unable to list/use tools).

**Research Findings**: OpenAI expects specific tool patterns for MCP integration that differ from our current ClickUp-focused approach.

**Success Criteria**: Both OpenAI ChatGPT and Claude Desktop can discover and use MCP tools without breaking changes to existing functionality.

---

## 1. Problem Analysis & Research Findings

### 1.1 Current Integration Status
- ‚úÖ **Claude Desktop**: Full functionality with all ClickUp tools
- ‚ùå **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Cannot properly discover/use tools via Custom Connector
- üéØ **Target**: Universal compatibility without breaking changes

### 1.2 Key Research Discoveries

#### OpenAI MCP Expectations (from platform.openai.com research):
```
"The Deep Research agent relies specifically on Search and Fetch tools. 
Search should look through your object store for a set of specific, top-k IDs. 
Fetch, is a tool that takes objectIds as arguments and pulls back the relevant resources."
```

**Critical Insight**: OpenAI expects **universal document search/retrieval tools**, not domain-specific task tools.

#### Current vs Expected Tool Patterns:

**Our Current Implementation:**
```javascript
// ClickUp-specific, task-focused
{name: "search", description: "Search ClickUp tasks by keyword..."}
{name: "fetch", description: "Fetch a ClickUp task by id..."}
```

**OpenAI's Expectation:**
```javascript  
// Universal, document-focused
{name: "search", description: "Search through content stores for relevant documents..."}
{name: "fetch", description: "Retrieve specific documents by ID from content stores..."}
```

### 1.3 Architecture Insight
OpenAI treats MCP servers as **universal document/knowledge retrieval systems** that can work with any content store (databases, file systems, knowledge bases, etc.), not just task management systems.

---

## 2. Investigation Areas for Implementation

### 2.1 Current Codebase Analysis Needed

**Explore and Understand:**
- How are tools currently registered and exposed via the `/mcp` endpoint?
- What patterns exist for tool definition and handler routing?
- Are there existing content abstraction layers or service patterns?
- How is the `tools/list` response currently constructed?
- What error handling and response formatting patterns should be maintained?

**Key Files to Investigate:**
- Tool registration and routing mechanisms
- Current search/fetch implementations
- Service layer architecture
- Response formatting utilities
- Configuration management patterns

### 2.2 MCP Protocol Implementation Review

**Verify Current MCP Compliance:**
- Does `/mcp` endpoint properly handle `tools/list` requests?
- Are `tools/call` invocations working correctly for Claude but failing for OpenAI?
- Is the issue in tool discovery, tool execution, or response formatting?
- Are there differences in how OpenAI vs Claude call the MCP endpoints?

**Debug the Integration:**
- Log OpenAI's actual requests to identify failure points
- Compare OpenAI vs Claude request patterns
- Verify JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance in responses

## 3. Strategic Solution Framework

### 3.1 Core Principle: Additive Compatibility
**DO NOT break existing Claude functionality** - Add OpenAI compatibility through additional capabilities.

### 3.2 Dual-Tool Strategy

**Universal Tools (for OpenAI's document-oriented workflows):**
- `search`: Universal content search across stores
- `fetch`: Universal content retrieval by ID

**ClickUp Tools (for comprehensive task management):**
- All existing ClickUp tools remain unchanged
- Both OpenAI and Claude get access to complete ClickUp functionality

### 3.3 Content Store Abstraction Approach

**Research Implementation Options:**
1. **Adapter Pattern**: Create content store adapters that present ClickUp data as searchable documents
2. **Service Extension**: Extend existing services to support document-oriented queries
3. **Facade Pattern**: Create universal tool facades over existing ClickUp operations

**Key Decision Points:**
- How to best integrate with existing service architecture?
- What patterns already exist for data abstraction?
- How to maintain performance while adding flexibility?

---

## 4. Implementation Research & Design

### 4.1 Universal Search Tool Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Accept text queries and return ranked document results
- Work with ClickUp tasks as primary content source
- Provide document IDs for subsequent fetch operations
- Support filtering and limiting results
- Present ClickUp tasks in document-friendly format

**Technical Considerations:**
- Leverage existing ClickUp search/filtering logic
- Maintain performance characteristics
- Use existing name matching and ranking utilities
- Follow current response formatting patterns

### 4.2 Universal Fetch Tool Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- Accept content IDs and return full document content
- Transform ClickUp tasks into document-style content
- Include metadata for rich context
- Support ClickUp task IDs (both regular and custom)
- Graceful error handling for missing content

**Technical Considerations:**
- Reuse existing task retrieval logic
- Transform task data into readable document format
- Preserve all task metadata for rich responses
- Handle both ClickUp task IDs and potential future content types

### 4.3 Integration Architecture Options

**Option A: Content Store Abstraction Layer**
```
Universal Tools ‚Üí Content Store Interface ‚Üí ClickUp Store Implementation
```

**Option B: Service Layer Extension**
```
Universal Tools ‚Üí Enhanced Services ‚Üí Existing ClickUp Services
```

**Option C: Tool Facade Pattern**
```
Universal Tools ‚Üí Tool Adapters ‚Üí Existing ClickUp Tools
```

**Research Needed**: Which approach best fits the existing codebase architecture?
